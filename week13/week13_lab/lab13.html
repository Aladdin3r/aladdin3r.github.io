            <p>
                Nelson Mandela was, in many ways, during his lifetime, a practitioner of Mahatma Gandhi’s
                 philosophy of Satyagraha or Truth Force, passive resistance and Ahimsa or non-violence.

                    Mahatma Gandhi was the primary leader of India’s independence movement and also the architect of a form of non-violent civil disobedience that would influence the world. Until Gandhi was assassinated in 1948, 
                    his life and teachings inspired activists including Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela.

                    Mahatma Gandhi was the leader of India’s non-violent independence movement against British rule and in South Africa who advocated for the civil rights of Indians. Born in Porbandar, India, Gandhi studied law and organized boycotts against 
                    British institutions in peaceful forms of civil disobedience. He was killed by a fanatic in 1948.
